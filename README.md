# india-state-guess-game
This project will show you how much easy it is to build a India's state guessing game using pandas in Python. In this project, you have to guess all 28 states of India. The game can be turned off at any time, just by entering 'exit' in the input prompt. If you guess all 28 states correctly, the game screen will go off, but if you exit the game before that, a .csv file is generated, which will contain the name of states which you were not able to guess correctly.
